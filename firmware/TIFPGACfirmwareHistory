	  FPGA usercode: 0x710x2yyz, x=0 for Rev2 TI, x=1 for production TI;
										 yy firmware version, z firmware revision, "yy.z"
     Apr. 15, 2014.  Based on TIFPGA V18 design.  The structure is re-orgnized so that
	it is easier for others to re-use the design. A dump module ROC2Read is added to 
	test the multi-ROC logic.
     Apr. 22, 2014. Fixed some importing issues, trigger/readout/sync/clock are OK.
	Set the SReset(n)=0xNN, no more changing offset.
     Apr. 29, 2014. Change the SdLink, TpLink from iobufds to ibufds, so the DIFF_TERM can be enabled.
     May 16, 2014: Update the design to TIFPGA v20.2.  Printed the full design out and tested

V1.1 May 20, 2014: first released version.  Bench tested.
v1.2 June 2, 2014: fixed the clock inconsistency on IRQ counter and upcount signal.
V1.3 June 4, 2014: remove the SyncEvtSet from BlkCnt(7:0) counter reset, delay the SyncEvtSet so that
    it will not block the previous trigger processing(two events are coming closely).  Close the 32ns
	 window that the SyncEvtSet will be reset by the earlier acknowledgement.
V2.1 June 10, 2014: add the TI-GTP communication.  The data is pushed out only when the full block is ready.
V2.2 June 12, 2014: The TI should be compatible with both the CTP and GTP,
v2.3 June 16, 2014: Add the sync (to Clk100) reset to the GTP Rx_Tx block, esp. the OSERDES
V2.4 June 17, 2014: Update the VME module from v7 to v8.  Add the Sync code 0xee to generate a 4us SyncReset;
    On TI, the Bulb mode syncReset will generate a 8ns Reset on the falling edge of the BULB reset.
	 Accept GTP block level request, transmit Block_Level, and SyncEvent marker.
V3.1 July 9, 2014: Set the OT#2 as the prompt trigger output.  For TImaster, this is the trigger rule gated
    triggers, for other TI, this is the HFBR#1 received triggers (quick decode). The width is adjusted (14ns-530ns)
V3.2 Aug. 21, 2014: set 0x00 reg bit(12:8) to the A24 address (VME64x slot, or switch setting for non-vme64x);
    bit(13) is the VME64x slot# parity; Disable the periodic transfer of trigger source enabled/disabled.
	 When used as TImaster, the loopback may lose SYNC command (several %) as discovered Nov. 5, 2014.
V4.1 Oct. 3, 2014: fix the problem that when there is no event, the fill block at end of run will generate one block.
    This is bug is caused by the mti firmware, when the logic is moved.  (BlkCnt was number of event count).
V4.2 Oct. 16, 2014: Added the Trigger2 to generate Trigger1 logic (on TImaster).  Seperated the Trigger rule logic,
    so that the TrigRule is a block called by the TsGen.  Separate the trigger quadrant timing for Trg1, Trg2 and Sync.
	 This revision has a bug that mis-aligned the Periodic Sync signal.  There is no periodic sync event generated.
V4.3 Oct. 20, 2014: Expand the SyncEvtGen from 16 bit to 20 bit.  The max periodic sync event is every 1M blocks.
    Reg offset 0x34 bit(27:24) is read out as the number of interrupt blocks.  As the block ready is much slower, and
	 uncertain as the other ROC could back pressure the data.  
V4.4 Oct. 21, 2014: remove one clock (16ns) from SyncEvtSet delay (0x34 readout only), Error LED enabled by Fiber use.
V5.1 Oct. 29, 2014: Timing the SYNC command (only as TImaster) to send on the 192ns boundary.
V5.2-5.f Nov. 6, 2014: Added a IODELAY at Ad9510 clk_sync, to test the slower clock phase alignment
V6.1 Nov. 7, 2014: The AD9510 ClkSync has perfect timing without the IODELAY.  Remove it.  Added one FD before the OFD_1,
    just in case that the timing is not good.
V6.2 Dec. 4, 2014: Output the Token from VME module to register offset 0x1C bit 16 (VME setting).
V6.4 Dec. 18, 2014: Delay the MGT reset upon 0x22 sync command (wait until the DCM is locked)); Change the MGTreset input
    logic, so that the 16-bit time stay at 0 normally;
V7.1 Dec. 22, 2014: Add the trigger lock busy, that is the TI has to respond with TrigReceived before next trigger.
V7.2 Jan. 5, 2015: use offset 0x28 register bit 22 to monitor the trigger loss (to match with bit 6 setting).
V7.3 Jan. 8, 2015: Output the HFBR received prompt trigger on 4ns precision
V7.4 Jan. 8, 2015: re-arrange the MGT_RxReset, (only once), and the forced idle will cover ~1ms after GTPreset.
V8.1 Jan. 14, 2015: Limit the sync code 0xDD to TI/TD/TS only.  This reset will not be distributed to SD, or other modules.
V9.1 Feb. 9, 2015: Use common library (modules).  The common area will be used on TI, TD, TS and TIpcie.
    The 0x74 register will be for event type setting, and the 0x44, 0x64 will be used for front panel TSin code control.
    The trigger table load may have been changed too
V9.2 Feb. 16, 2015: Re-do the prompt trigger pulse width logic, so that the PromptTrigger width is on Clk250 only.
V9.3 Feb. 23, 2015: Connect the SCReadEn from VME module to SYNC module
V10.1 Mar. 17, 2015: Use Clk250 for TS#code input lookup tables, to minimize the latency
    Update the TI<-->GTP communication first (ModTI, v8.3); Add the proper VME readback;
	 
	 V9.# and V10.# are to be overwritten by ModTI compile
 
V1.1, Mar. 26, 2015: TIFPGA usercode: 0x710x3011, x=0 for rev2 TI, x=1 for prod TI PCBs, The front BUSY meaning depends on MasterMode
V1.2, Apr. 10, 2015: Add the delay adjustment for TS_code inputs, extend the periodic trigger to ~0.5 Hz
V1.3, Apr. 13, 2015: recover the Trigger2-->Trigger1 generation logic.  The generation was working, but the latency setting was not.
V1.4, Apr. 16, 2015: Change the auto sync reset code from 0xDD to 0xEE, fix the AutoSyncRst (to match with 24-clock cycles SYNC
    command); Use Clk625/ClkDiv instead of the Clk3125 for AutoSyncReset generation.
V1.5, Apr. 21, 2015: TrigRule range expansion, Rule#4 reached ~500 us.
V1.6, May 7, 2015: Add the extra trigger word decoding in receiving.  The extra word should be immediately after the trigger word.
V1.7, May 21, 2015: Add some more BUSY counters (each BUSY source).  Use 0x34 bit(26:24) for number of events for Fastbus readout.
V1.8, June 17, 2015: use 0x34 bit(23:21) for number of events for FASTBUS readout.  Bit(27:24) back to its original.  
V1.9, July 23, 2015: Delay the ForcedBlkEnd by one clock cycle (4ns), to match with the ReadOutTrg generated BlkEnd
     Added the explicit limit on register setting Command(15:9)=0000000.
V2.1, Oct. 8, 2015: Add a minimum BUSY rule width setting (0x138).
V2.2, Oct. 13, 2015: Add another event data word for trigger input patterns (raw input pattern).  Use common GTP and MgtpReset modules.
V2.3, Nov. 18, 2015: Add the trigger pulse delay adjustment.  0x0C, When bit7=1 or bit23=1, use larger step.
V2.4, Dec. 18, 2015: The added trigger pulse delay affected the ReadoutTrg timing relative to the DSyncEvt (v2.3), fix it
