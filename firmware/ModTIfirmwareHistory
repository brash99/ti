
ModTI history
	  FPGA usercode: 0x710x2yyz, x=0 for Rev2 TI, x=1 for production TI;
										 yy firmware version, z firmware revision, "yy.z"
     Apr. 15, 2014.  Based on TIFPGA V18 design.  The structure is re-orgnized so that
	it is easier for others to re-use the design. A dump module ROC2Read is added to 
	test the multi-ROC logic.
     Apr. 22, 2014. Fixed some importing issues, trigger/readout/sync/clock are OK.
	Set the SReset(n)=0xNN, no more changing offset.
     Apr. 29, 2014. Change the SdLink, TpLink from iobufds to ibufds, so the DIFF_TERM can be enabled.
     May 16, 2014: Update the design to TIFPGA v20.2.  Printed the full design out and tested

V1.1 May 20, 2014: first released version.  Bench tested.
v1.2 June 2, 2014: fixed the clock inconsistency on IRQ counter and upcount signal.
V1.3 June 4, 2014: remove the SyncEvtSet from BlkCnt(7:0) counter reset, delay the SyncEvtSet so that
    it will not block the previous trigger processing(two events are coming closely).  Close the 32ns
	 window that the SyncEvtSet will be reset by the earlier acknowledgement.
V2.1 June 10, 2014: add the TI-GTP communication.  The data is pushed out only when the full block is ready.
V2.2 June 12, 2014: The TI should be compatible with both the CTP and GTP,
v2.3 June 16, 2014: Add the sync (to Clk100) reset to the GTP Rx_Tx block, esp. the OSERDES
V2.4 June 17, 2014: Update the VME module from v7 to v8.  Add the Sync code 0xee to generate a 4us SyncReset;
    On TI, the Bulb mode syncReset will generate a 8ns Reset on the falling edge of the BULB reset.
	 Accept GTP block level request, transmit Block_Level, and SyncEvent marker.
V3.1 July 9, 2014: Set the OT#2 as the prompt trigger output.  For TImaster, this is the trigger rule gated
    triggers, for other TI, this is the HFBR#1 received triggers (quick decode). The width is adjusted (14ns-530ns)
V3.2 Aug. 21, 2014: set 0x00 reg bit(12:8) to the A24 address (VME64x slot, or switch setting for non-vme64x);
    bit(13) is the VME64x slot# parity; Disable the periodic transfer of trigger source enabled/disabled.
	 When used as TImaster, the loopback may lose SYNC command (several %) as discovered Nov. 5, 2014.
V4.1 Oct. 3, 2014: fix the problem that when there is no event, the fill block at end of run will generate one block.
    This is bug is caused by the mti firmware, when the logic is moved.  (BlkCnt was number of event count).
V4.2 Oct. 16, 2014: Added the Trigger2 to generate Trigger1 logic (on TImaster).  Seperated the Trigger rule logic,
    so that the TrigRule is a block called by the TsGen.  Separate the trigger quadrant timing for Trg1, Trg2 and Sync.
	 This revision has a bug that mis-aligned the Periodic Sync signal.  There is no periodic sync event generated.
V4.3 Oct. 20, 2014: Expand the SyncEvtGen from 16 bit to 20 bit.  The max periodic sync event is every 1M blocks.
    Reg offset 0x34 bit(27:24) is read out as the number of interrupt blocks.  As the block ready is much slower, and
	 uncertain as the other ROC could back pressure the data.  
V4.4 Oct. 21, 2014: remove one clock (16ns) from SyncEvtSet delay (0x34 readout only), Error LED enabled by Fiber use.
V5.1 Oct. 29, 2014: Timing the SYNC command (only as TImaster) to send on the 192ns boundary.
V5.2-5.f Nov. 6, 2014: Added a IODELAY at Ad9510 clk_sync, to test the slower clock phase alignment
V6.1 Nov. 7, 2014: The AD9510 ClkSync has perfect timing without the IODELAY.  Remove it.  Added one FD before the OFD_1,
    just in case that the timing is not good.
